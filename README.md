# Talking Discord JS bot

### What is this?

- This is a discord bot made to join the voice/text chat and listen to someone talk and/or write a msg and respond

### Why was it made?

- This bot was made as a spur of the moment thing, initially the idea was for the bot to join a DnD campaign or be used as a side character in it when needed
- After looking online there were no discord bots or discord bot examples that did what was needed:
  - record audio
  - play audio
  - receive  messages 
  - respond to messages
  - Have some integration with AI Language Models
- After finishing the initial version of this and using it I felt that a publicly availabe version would be useful to help anyone else who might in the future want to make something similar do it faster

## Known Issues

- There is a bug where it listens twice if you put the speaker as someone else

## To Improve

- Typescript?
- Tests?
- Error Handling
- Support for other services that you could switch between like with the language (differnt AI Language Models, speech-to-text..etc)
